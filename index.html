        <h1>Gödel Escher Bach - MIU System</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently reading Gödel Escher Bach. His first formal system he introduces is the MIU system.
            It follows four rules.
            <ol>
                <li>If you posses a string whose last letter is I, you can add on a U at the end.</li>
                <li>Suppose you have Mx. Then you may add Mxx to your collection.
                <li>If III occurs in one of the string in your collection, you may make a new string with U in place of III</li>
                <li>If UU occurs inside one of your strings, you can drop it.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>The Goal of the Book is to get from MI to MU.</strong>
            You can use the applet below to apply the rules, for feedback, check the console.
