        <h1>Gödel Escher Bach - MIU System</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently reading Gödel Escher Bach. His first formal system he introduces is the MIU system.
            It follows four rules.
            <ol>
                <li>If you posses a string whose last letter is I, you can add on a U at the end.</li>
                <li>Suppose you have Mx. Then you may add Mxx to your collection.
                <li>If III occurs in one of the string in your collection, you may make a new string with U in place of III</li>
                <li>If UU occurs inside one of your strings, you can drop it.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>The Goal of the Book is to get from MI to MU.</strong>
            You can use the applet below to apply the rules, for feedback, check the console.

        <h2>So how to get from the <code>I</code> to the <code>U</code>?</h2>
        
        <p>The only rule that can reduce the number of <code>I</code> the the 3rd rule, so we should focus on that.
        To remove all <code>I</code>, we need to fullfill <code>count(I) mod 3 = 0</code>, which means that the number of <code>I</code> must be divisible by 3.
        <code>count</code> represents the number of <code>I</code>, <code>mod</code> is the mathematical operation modulo.</p>
        
        <p>With the second rule, we can duplicate the starting <code>I</code>.
        But doubling a number that is not divisible by 3 will never make it divisible by 3.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Proof sketch:</strong>
            <p>Suppose you have a number <code>n</code> that is not divisible by 3, so <code>n mod 3 != 0</code>, which means that <code>n = x * 3 + y</code>, where <code>x</code> can be any number and <code>y</code> is 1 or 2.
            When doubling the number we get <code>n * 2 = x * 6 + y * 2</code>.
            <code>y * 2</code> is now 2 or 4, both numbers are still not divisible by 2. <code>x * 6</code> is divisible by 3, so adding 2 or 4 will make it not divisible by 3.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Reducing the number of <code>I</code> by 3 obviously won't help, we can only use this rule in a useful way when we already have a number that is divisible by 3.
        All other rules don't affect the number of <code>I</code>.</p>
        
        <p>So the first exercise given by Douglas Hofstadter in <em>Gödel Escher Bach</em> is <strong>impossible</strong> to solve.</p>
        
        <p>When you don't believe this proof, simply try it out and check if you're able to find a solution. <em>You won't.</em></p>
